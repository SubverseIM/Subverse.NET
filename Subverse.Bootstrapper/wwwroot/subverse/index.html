        <h2>Who is this for?</h2>
        <p>Currently, if you are trying to get started with your own Subverse "hub" instance, look for the documentation included with your server distribution package. In it, you should find a section regarding "Bootstrapping", be sure to read that guidance, and when applicable, use the URL of this page to configure your instance's bootstrapper API server.</p>

        <h2>I'm still confused...</h2>
        <p>Not to worry, the Subverse developer community is hard at work, implementing the network's first ever client applications. Once those are ready for public use, this page will be updated with more info on how to get started as an ordinary user of the Subverse Network!</p>
